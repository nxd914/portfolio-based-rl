# Paper

This directory contains a LaTeX draft of a technical paper describing the portfolio RL framework.

## Build
- Compile with `pdflatex` or a LaTeX toolchain.

## Results
The Results section currently contains placeholders. Fill this by running real experiments and substituting in actual metrics.

Recommended workflow:
1) Run walk-forward experiments with real data and export results using `out_dir` in `run_walk_forward`.
2) Aggregate metrics from `summary.json` into LaTeX tables (manual or scripted).
3) Replace the placeholder values in `main.tex`.
